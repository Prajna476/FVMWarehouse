# FVM Warehouse

Developers tools to enable inventory and work order management,  preventive and reactive maintenance at the warehouse using Filecoin Virtual machine and ecosystem tools, ZK invoice listing verification on Starknet and decentralized CI/CD deployment using Fleek, Lit, Fluence and Web3 eco-system tools.

There are 2 key features of our solution:

FVM  Inventory Manager: For digitizing inventory management and work order pipeline forms, analyzing data, and automating asset management workflows like procurement, repair and reinforcements.

Starknet and Web3 Work Order Tracker using FVM analytics and CDN services: For developers and system integrators building cross-platform monitoring Work Order manager and dapps for tracking work invoices, inventory management and work listing verification using sensors and oscilloscope with low code while retaining dapp core principles and flexibility using Fleek, Lit, Fluence and Web3 ecosystem tools.

# Blockchain Eco-system

# Filecoin Virtual Machine 

Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM): FVM enables us to use building blocks exposed through interfaces, enabling the construction of incident archiving solutions. This improves better outcomes for monitoring, incident reporting, and precision maintenance at the warehouse. We are using FVM for:

Creating a Warehouse Service Ticket NFT on the FVM for NFC tags of service and repair providers to improve incident management, decentralized NFT-based voting system for contract work by service providers, Votes are uploaded to IPFS with the most recent vote linking to one before.

Decentralized NFT-based voting system for contract work for warehouse service & maintenance providers and companies. DAOs can issue NFTs to wallets based on service and maintenance performance and work completed, and the holders of these NFTs can create proposals and vote on other proposals whilst they have the NFTs of that contract work.

FVM enables us to develop and use composable blocks and ensure effective design, engineering and delivery of a decentralized solution for warehouse monitoring and incident management using Filecoin eco-system tools.

Automated Workflow for decentralized voting for Warehouse service providers and Data  DAOs on Filecoin Virtual Machine:

Warehouse DAOs create a RFP for providing service or maintenance using work orders on the dapp.
Warehouse service providers can join a RFP by minting an NFT of that RFP. This NFT is created on FVM.
Warehouse service providers that have a certain RFP's NFT are eligible to create proposals and vote on them.
Voting is gasless and the vote is stored on IPFS and Filecoin with the most recent vote linking to one before.
Votes are uploaded to IPFS with the most recent vote linking to one before. This is done by storing the previous vote's CID in the file of the newest one. Therefore a chain of verifiable data is created. 


# Starknet

We are developing a Starknet based dapp solution, which offers an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes Giza for sorting information obtained from warehouse locations, cameras deployed at monitoring spots.

Further, we are developing a Starknet utility token (Starknet Warehouse Pro Token) using Cairo, Open Zeppelin and enabling Smart incentivization using both Ethereum and Starknet blockchains, Pay with QR code dapp, EtherCalc.

Vehicle Repair and Service NFTs on Starknet enable:

Enable hyperlocal warehouse service and repair delivery information.
Enable QR code based blockchain payments at warehouse sites with support for key Ethereum based blockchain platforms.
Enhance warehouse safety through smart incentivization of incident reporting by employees and logistics providers.

# Fleek

We are developing an Inventory Management and Warehouse DAO platform and deploying on Fleek that enables warehouse service providers, logistics aggregators and corporate organizations to keep track of all the details of their inventory and warehouse assets,  procurements and refurbishments, transactions across all multiple chains and also display DAO data using Fleek CDN services and a data visualization chart. 

Fleek CDN services  enable scalability and token bridge operations using ERC20 token supply across multiple platforms and blockchains that improve the overall usability and interoperability.

Demo for Fleek Usage and Deployment in FVM Warehouse https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1rmz14tGln6nalv8qgPmRje5LiP8kzLVL ( demo-video.mp4 )

Web3 Asset Tracker dapp on Fleek also provides the requisite features to share weather conditions like humidity, temperature and conditions, enable remotely monitoring the warehouse using WeatherXM and sync services on used tablets and phones, integration with IP cameras, safety alarms. The cost of deployment and added technology is limited which could help the warehouse owners operate safely and cost effectively in a variety of geographical regions.

# Lit

We are using Lit protocol to automate signing, reading, and writing warehouse work order attestations and inventory insurance NFT data to web3 decentralized networks:

1. Lit Actions: We are using JS function bindings to enable warehouse security data operations like request a signature or a decryption.

2. Token-gate the Work Order Dashboard Page with admin and contractor personas using Lit Protocol.

# Galadriel

We are using Galadriel to develop an AI agent for incident summarization during supply chain management and logistics services and for managing fraud detection and insurance inventory management at the warehouse location. This enables incident management and early stage detection of goods and equipment insurance issues in case of an incident.

Demos at https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1X3lQ12CRuyswVenF53UZakYcl86UbxQk

Workflow and Core Objectives for building Warehouse AI agents on Galadriel devnet:

Decentralized platform for warehouse and logistics incident reporting and summarization by employees and contractors.

Community-driven approach to improving warehouse safety 

Integration of advanced technologies for incident summarization, detection and prevention.

Smart incentivization using QR code dapp, EtherCalc.


# Lilypad

We are developing a Warehouse Equipment NFT and a Service/Repair Work Order NFT for preventive maintenance at the warehouse on the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM / FEVM) using Lilypad with Bacalhau Stable Diffusion. This is utilized for developing warehouse service and work order flows, enabling preventive maintenance via integration with alarm clock dapp and logistics scheduler for heavy goods using inter-state trains.

This enables us to share and delegate a Work Order NFT on the FVM, enable decentralized NFT-based voting system for contract work by warehouse service providers, Votes are uploaded to IPFS/FVM with the most recent vote linking to one before. 


# Mona Wallet Unity SDK

We are building a zk Wallet solution using Mona Unity Wallet SDK to enable  an AR/VR solution for preventive maintenance of the warehouse.
We wish to support operations like the signing of the transaction for the 3d NFTS of warehouse equipment and other cryptographic operations across multiple platforms and blockchains that improve the overall usability and interoperability.  We have developed a Warehouse spare parts NFT marketplace powered by Metamask Unity SDK and Snaps. 

We are trying to enable the zk wallet solution developed using Mona Unity Wallet SDK with Metamask Unity SDK in the 3d warehouse metaverse for an AR/VR solution for preventive maintenance of the warehouse.
