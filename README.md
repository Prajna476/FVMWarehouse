# FVM Warehouse

Developers tools to enable inventory and work order management,  preventive and reactive maintenance at the warehouse using Filecoin Virtual machine and ecosystem tools, ZK invoice listing verification on Starknet and decentralized CI/CD deployment using Fleek, Lit, Fluence and Web3 eco-system tools.

There are 2 key features of our solution:

FVM  Inventory Manager: For digitizing inventory management and work order pipeline forms, analyzing data, and automating asset management workflows like procurement, repair and reinforcements.

Starknet and Web3 Work Order Tracker using FVM analytics and CDN services: For developers and system integrators building cross-platform monitoring Work Order manager and dapps for tracking work invoices, inventory management and work listing verification using sensors and oscilloscope with low code while retaining dapp core principles and flexibility using Fleek, Lit, Fluence and Web3 ecosystem tools.

# Blockchain Eco-system

# Filecoin Virtual Machine and Filecoin

Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM): FVM enables us to use building blocks exposed through interfaces, enabling the construction of incident archiving solutions. This improves better outcomes for monitoring, incident reporting, and precision maintenance at the warehouse. We are using FVM for:

Creating a Warehouse Service Ticket NFT on the FVM for NFC tags of service and repair providers to improve incident management, decentralized NFT-based voting system for contract work by service providers, Votes are uploaded to IPFS with the most recent vote linking to one before.

Decentralized NFT-based voting system for contract work for warehouse service & maintenance providers and companies. DAOs can issue NFTs to wallets based on service and maintenance performance and work completed, and the holders of these NFTs can create proposals and vote on other proposals whilst they have the NFTs of that contract work.

FVM enables us to develop and use composable blocks and ensure effective design, engineering and delivery of a decentralized solution for warehouse monitoring and incident management using Filecoin eco-system tools.

Automated Workflow for decentralized voting for Warehouse service providers and Data  DAOs on Filecoin Virtual Machine:

Warehouse DAOs create a RFP for providing service or maintenance using work orders on the dapp.
Warehouse service providers can join a RFP by minting an NFT of that RFP. This NFT is created on FVM.
Warehouse service providers that have a certain RFP's NFT are eligible to create proposals and vote on them.
Voting is gasless and the vote is stored on IPFS and Filecoin with the most recent vote linking to one before.
Votes are uploaded to IPFS with the most recent vote linking to one before. This is done by storing the previous vote's CID in the file of the newest one. Therefore a chain of verifiable data is created.
